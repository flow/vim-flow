1. Introduction                                                   *hack-intro*

Hack is a programming language for HHVM that interoperates seamlessly with PHP.
It enables programmers to explicitly annotate their PHP code with static types
and introduces other powerful language constructs such as collections and async
functions.  See http://hacklang.org/ for further information about Hack.

Hack provides quick type information at "compile" time via a local server that
watches a Hack source directory.  The client program `hh_client' offers a rich
interface to the type information that the `hh_server' maintains.  This vim
package integrates this functionality into vim in order to provide two major
functionalities:

Error handling using the |quickfix| window:
- Type checking; e.g., function foo() has return type `string', which is
  incompatible with `int'.
- Syntax errors; e.g., `return' without a semicolon.
- Other errors; e.g., a class is missing an implementation for an abstract
  method.

Omnicompletion:
- Type $this-><C-x><C-o> and get a context- and type- aware auto complete menu,
  containing only the methods and properties on $this, along with type info.
- Type $<C-x><C-o> and get a list of local variables.

Hack's detailed type error traces and stored context can make these invaluable
tools when working with code anywhere along the spectrum of PHP to strictly-
typed Hack.

2. Quickfix                                                    *hack-quickfix*

The Hack typechecker plugin exposes the following functions:

  hack#typecheck()......Invoke the typechecker.               |hack-typecheck|
      +--aliased as :HackMake

  hack#find_refs(fn)....List all uses of function `fn'.       |hack-find-refs|
      +--aliased as :HackFindRefs

  hack#get_type().......Get the Hack type of the Hack          |hack-get-type|
                        expression under the cursor.
      +--aliased as :HackType

  hack#toggle().........Toggle whether or not the typechecker    |hack-toggle|
                        runs on a buffer when it's written.
      +--aliased as :HackToggle

In addition, the following configuration flags are exposed:

  hack#enable=1     Whether or not Hack runs the typechecker on the current
                    buffer when it is written.  This is the same flag which is
                    toggled by hack#toggle().

  hack#autoclose=1  Whether the quickfix window is closed automatically if the
                    typechecker is run with no errors.

  hack#errjmp=0     Whether to automatically jump to the buffer and position of
                    the first error found by the typechecker when it is run.
                    Defaults to off.

  hack#qfsize=1     Whether to resize the quickfix window automatically to a
                    reasonable size, for some definition of reasonable.  Note
                    that this affects quickfix windows globally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *HackMake*  *hack-typecheck*

Suppose we create a PHP file in the `hh_server' root directory called foo.php,
with the following contents:

  <?hh

  class Foo {
    private ?int $bar;

    public function baz(): int {
      return $this->bar;
    }
  }

Invoking :HackMake, calling hack#typecheck(), or, by default, writing the
buffer, will yield the following in the quickfix window:

  foo.php|7 col 12 error|  Invalid return type
  foo.php|6 col 26 error|  This is an int
  foo.php|4 col 11 error|  It is incompatible with a nullable type

The expressive Hack errors are all imported into the quickfix list, which can
be interfaced with :cc, :cn, :cp, and other |quickfix| commands as usual.

The behavior of this functionality can be controlled by the configuration flags
described above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              *HackFindRefs*  *hack-find-refs*

The Hack server also keeps track of references to each defined function.  To
populate the quickfix window with such a list for, e.g., the function
Foo::quux(), simply execute

  :HackFindRefs Foo::quux

Presently, the returned list will have entries of the form

  blah.php|35 col 15 error|

though this is subject to future improvement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *HackType*  *hack-get-type*

The Hack server can be queried for the type of a given variable or value
anywhere in the program.  If the cursor is over `$this->bar' in the example for
|hack-typecheck|, then executing

  :HackType

will echo the line

  HackType: ?int

This is not restricted to explicitly typed properties, but works also for local
variables and function returns.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *HackToggle*  *hack-toggle*

The hack#toggle() function and :HackToggle command simply flip the value of
hack#enable, making it easy to turn the typecheck-on-save feature off and on.

===============================================================================
3. Autocomplete                                                *hack-omnifunc*

Autocomplete functionality is built natively into the Hack client.  Suppose we
have the following source code:

  <?hh

  class Foo {
    private ?int $bar;

    public function baz(): int {
      return $this->b
    }
  }

and we enter insert mode, with the cursor after the `$this->b'.  Using
omnicompletion with <CTRL-x><CTRL-o> yields an autocomplete menu containing:

  bar v ?int
  baz f (): int

Omnicompletion settings are configurable in the usual way, e.g., with
|'completeopt'|; the omnicomplete menu is navigable in the usual way with
<CTRL-n> and <CTRL-p>.  See |compl-omni| for further documentation on
omnicompletion.

Since Hack types code quickly across the source tree, Hack omnicomplete
provides fast completion with full knowledge of your codebase.
